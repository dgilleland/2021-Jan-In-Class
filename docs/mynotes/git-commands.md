# Git on the Command Line

We can use the git version control application directly from the command line. Here are some useful commands to get started.

- `git status` - This will give you the current status of your git repository
- `git add .` - Use this command to "stage" all of your current changes so that they are ready to be committed.
- `git commit -m "Your Message"` - This command will take all of the staged changes and create a snapshot of the current state of your repository. Using commits is how we generate a *commit history* for our repository.
- `git pull` - Use this command to grab any changes from your remote repository (e.g.: GitHub.com) and pull them down onto your local repository (the one on your computer).
- `git push` - This command will take whatever commits you have on your computer and push them to the remote repository on GitHub.com.

There are a lot of things to learn when it comes to working with git, but these commands are the day-to-day ones that you will do as you work with version control.

> **TIP:** You should make frequent, small commits when working on your projects.
