# Sandbox

This is a place where I can put any experimental work as part of my learning.

TODO:

- [ ] Take two samples from your Web Design Fundamentals and place them in separate folders under the `sandbox` folder. These should have at least one page each along with CSS and images.
  - [ ] Commit and push the workbook to GitHub.
